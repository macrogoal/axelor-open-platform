= Details View
:toc:
:toc-title:

The details view shows grid and form views side-by-side as a single view. It can be defined
using `action-view` using a view parameter `details-view`.

[source,xml]
----
<action-view name="team.tasks.all" model="com.axelor.team.db.TeamTask" title="Tasks">
  <view name="team-task-grid" type="grid" /> <1>
  <view name="team-task-form" type="form" /> <2>
  <view-param name="details-view" value="true" /> <3>
  <view-param name="details-view-mode" value="overlay" /> <4>
</action-view>
----
<1> the grid view used by this action
<2> the form view used by this action
<3> `details-view` params configures the grid view to show details view on the right side
<4> `details-view-mode` params configures how to show details view either as `overlay` (default - in form of popup)
or `inline` (it will show side by side to grid)

== Alternative form view

We can also provide alternative form view by specifying view name as `details-view` param value, like:

[source,xml]
----
<view-param name="details-view" value="another-form-view" />
----

== Grid width

When `details-view-mode` is set to `inline`, you can also customize the grid width by adding the `grid-width` param value:

[source,xml]
----
<view-param name="details-view-mode" value="inline" />
<view-param name="grid-width" value="25%" />
