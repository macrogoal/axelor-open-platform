View attributes are usually set directly in the XML of the view. Some of them can also be updated thanks to xref:dev-guide:actions/action-attrs.adoc[Attrs Actions].

But we can also configure view attributes directly from the UI for and even more advanced configuration.

== Overview

The configuration of these enhanced view attributes is done from the application UI, in the menu _Administration -> View Management -> View Attributes_.

They are evaluated on form view events `onNew` and `onLoad`, even if these attributes are not defined explicitly in the form view.
These attributes take the precedence over the ones defined on the XML view and in the _action-attrs_ (only during `onNew` and `onLoad` events for this latter).

== Available Fields

* *Model* _(Required)_ - The FQN of the name on which the view attribute should be applied.
* *View* _(Optional)_ - The name of the form view on which the view attribute should be applied. If empty, the attribute will be applied on all the form views representing the given model.
* *Field* _(Required)_ - The field on which the attribute should be applied. Custom fields are supported (example: _attrs.myCustomField_).
* *Order* _(Optional)_ - If several records set the same view attribute, define which one has the priority.
* *Name* _(Required)_ - The name of the attribute we want to set. Can be any value handled by usual xref:dev-guide:actions/action-attrs.adoc[Attrs Actions].
* *Name* _(Required)_ - The value of the attribute we want to set.
* *Condition* _(Optional)_ - A JS expression to set the attribute value if and only if the expression evaluates to true.
* *Roles* _(Optional)_ - A set of user roles on which this view attribute will be applied. If empty, the view attribute will be applied to all the users.
